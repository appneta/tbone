# TBone

Automagic event-binding for Backbone.

TBone removes the complexity of manually managing data dependencies in Backbone,
enabling "live" templates as well functions that automatically re-execute when
the data they reference changes.

TBone is designed to scale with your application, enabling simple re-use of
data throughout your application without you needing to tell the page what
to update when that data changes.

At AppNeta, we've used TBone to eliminate a set of custom page events
corresponding such as "refresh data" and "add filter"; with a large application,
it becomes difficult to manage what exactly needs to be refreshed when something
changes.  While Backbone is a critical step toward reducing this complexity,
TBone enables us to do so without even thinking about event binding; every view
and model stays in sync by design and without unnecessary work.
